== The Quarkus Project


The application was created with the following command:
[source]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.2.0.Final:create \
-DprojectGroupId=at.htl \
-DprojectArtifactId=ci-example \
-DprojectVersion=1.0 \
-DclassName="at.htl.boundary.HelloSource"
----

And necessary extensions are added in the directory of the project with the command:
[source]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="quarkus-resteasy,quarkus-resteasy-jsonb"
----

== Creating the Jenkins Project

Note, a GitHub Repository must already exist.
When logged in on the Jenkins at link:https://jenkins.vm81.htl-leonding.ac.at[], do the following:

1. Click the *New Item* menu on the left
2. Provide a Name for the item
3. Select *Multibranch Pipeline*
4. Go to the next page
5. Click *Add Source* and enter the HTTPS link to the github repo
6. Select the GitHub credentials: *htl-leonding-jenkins*

== Course of Action

The project now needs a *Jenkinsfile* in the root directory. Basically, the Jenkinsfile contains
information about what Jenkins should do. Usually it is split into the parts:

* Build
* Test
* Deploy

When working with Quarkus however, running the tests (at least the native tests)
in the Jenkinsfile is a lot more complicated.
This is because to build an executable with quarkus (and run it, the GraalVM has to be configured. On the school
Jenkins server the GraalVM is not configured, therefore a workaround is needed.

To build the project a multistage Dockerfile is used which starts from a base image that has the
GraalVM configured properly. When building the project with Maven, the tests are automatically run,
and if the tests fail, the build fails - which is also the reason why the Jenkinsfile does not need
a _Test Stage_. In this multistage Dockerfile native tests are also being run, which when they fail, also
cause the build to brake.

== The Dockerfile

[source]
----
include::src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage[]
----

This Dockerfile is taken from the Quarkus guide link:https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#creating-a-container-with-a-multi-stage-docker-build[Building a Native Image]
and has been modified. Firstly, the line:
[source]
----
FROM quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:19.3.1 AS build
----
has been changed to
----
FROM quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:19.3.1-java11 AS build
----
because the image tag does not exist. Check link:http://quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:19.3.1[]
to see other working tags.
Furthermore the command for executing the native tests has been added in the first stage of the build.
[source]
----
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.native-image-wait-time=300
----
Note, the -f states that the pom file is not in the working directory.

=== Introduction to the Jenkinsfile Syntax('s)

The Jenkinsfile actually refers to a _Pipeline_. The pipeline contains instructions on what Jenkins should do.
The Jenkinsfile can either be written with ...

* the declarative syntax for the *Declarative Pipeline*, or
* the scripted syntax for the *Scripted Pipeline*

From the link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Official Jenkins Documentation]: Declarative Pipeline is a relatively
recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems.
...

Scripted Pipeline, like Declarative Pipeline, is built on top of the underlying Pipeline sub-system. Unlike
Declarative, Scripted Pipeline is effectively a general-purpose DSL (Domain-Specific-Language) built with
Groovy. Most functionality provided by the Groovy language is made available to users of Scripted Pipeline, which means it can be a very expressive and flexible tool with which one can author continuous delivery pipelines.

==== Declarative Pipeline

With the declarative pipeline, a Jenkinsfile looks like this:
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent ...
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh '...'
                echo "..."
                ...
            }
        }
        ...
    }
}
----

Mostly, the agent is any if the stages use their own agents, or it declares some kind of docker image
to use to execute the commands of the stages. A stage can be named anything.

Here is an example of using a docker agent with maven to build java projects:
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'maven:3.6.3' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
----

==== Scripted Pipeline

With the scripted pipeline a Jenkinsfile looks like this:
[source,groovy]
----
node {
    stage('build') {
        sh '...'
        docker.image('maven:3.6.3').inside() {
            sh 'mvn --version'
        }
    }
}
----

=== Using Docker in the Pipeline

Since in this guide to deploying a Quarkus application using Jenkins, a Dockerfile is used to build
this project, we need to use docker in the pipeline. Jenkins has special features for this.
